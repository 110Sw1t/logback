		<h2>Logback Project</h2>

    <p>Logback is intended as a successor to the popular log4j
    project. It was designed by Ceki G&#252;lc&#252;, the founder of
    log4j. It builds upon experience gained in building
    industrial-strength logging systems going back as far as 1999.
		</p>

    <p>Logback's basic architecture is sufficiently generic so as to
    apply under different circumstances. At present time, logback is
    divided into three modules, logback-core, logback-classic and
    logback-access.
		</p>

		<p>The logback-core module lays the groundwork for the other two
		modules. The logback-classic module can be assimilated to a
		significantly improved version of log4j. Moreover, logback-classic
		natively implements the <a href="http://www.slf4j.org">SLF4J
		API</a> so that you can readily switch back and forth between
		logback and other logging systems such as log4j or
		java.util.logging (JUL).
    </p>

    <p>The logback-access module integrates with Servlet containers,
    such as Tomcat and Jetty, to provide HTTP-access log
    functionality. Note that you could easily build your own module
    on top of logback-core.
		</p>

    <h3>Sister projects</h3>

    <p>The <a href="http://audit.qos.ch">logback-audit</a> project is
    designed for processing logging events having long-term business
    significance. Logback-audit is commercial software based on
    logback-core.
